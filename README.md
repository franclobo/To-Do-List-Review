It is a copy from To Do List to review.

# To-Do-list

In this project, I will build a simple HTML list of To Do tasks. The list will be styled according to the specifications listed later in this lesson. This simple web page will be built using webpack and served by a webpack dev server.
This code is based on the videos: 
- https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ePzOFu2xXUQ
- https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MkESyVB4oUw&t=1904s 

And adapted to the Microverse requirements.

## Built With

- Visual Studio Code and GitHub.
- HTML, CSS and JavaScript.
- Linters for HTML, CSS and JavaScript.

## Getting Started

In this project, I will restructure my Awesome books app code. The goal is to make it more organized by using modules. I will also practice the ES6 syntax that I have learned.
